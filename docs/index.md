# CircuitCraft Documentation

Welcome to the CircuitCraft documentation. This documentation provides detailed 
information about CircuitCraft, a library for computing recursive functional 
operations commonly found in infinite dimensional decision making problems and 
economic models with uncertainty and heterogeneous agents.

## Contents

- **[Concepts](concepts/index.md)**: Detailed explanations of CircuitCraft's core 
  concepts, including perches, movers, circuit-boards, and lifecycle flags.
  
- **[Workflow](workflow/index.md)**: Comprehensive guide to the CircuitCraft workflow, 
  including circuit creation, model finalization, portability, initialization, and 
  solution.
  
- **[Examples](examples/index.md)**: Implementation examples demonstrating CircuitCraft's 
  capabilities, from simple mathematical operations to complex economic models.
  
- **[API Reference](api/index.md)**: Detailed documentation of CircuitCraft's classes, 
  methods, and functions.
  
- **[Theoretical Background](concepts/economic_motivation.md)**: Background on the 
  economic and mathematical theory behind CircuitCraft.
