 v1.2.2 
 TASK:
 At the moment it is  not explicit that the combined forward and backward graphs need to be eulerian to be a circuit. 

 Incorporate this. 

 Note that the forwars is simply the transfopose of the backward graph. 

 Of course the graphs forward and backward are still independent sub-graphs. 

 The full automaetic solution by defaults should be solve back, populated each target node as we move back. 

 Then solve forward.

 We need a check to make sure the full automatic solution back and foward is possible. 

 We also a check to make sure the graph is eulerian and a way to pliot it. at the moment these functions are in the eulerian.py

 Please implement the above updates to bring this to 1.2.4. make edits to changelog and also test the examples again and for each example that is not eularian, just put a note in saying so (dont edit it). Make a plot though foer each. 

 FInally, this idea was in my originalk read me(see ocntext) but was somehow watered down., please ensure it turns up in the read me. the fact that we have forward and bacward graphs that are transposed to eachotehr and are combiend to make an eulerian.
